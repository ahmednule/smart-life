# Smart-Life

Smart-Life is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. It aims to revolutionize local transport by offering an AI-powered tracking and navigation web app, making city life easier and more convenient.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
